# TaskRM

TaskRM is a fresh take on project and task management

The goal is to allow the user to be able to track everything that they want or need to do, while only focusing on what is actually important for the day.  

The catalog of all of the things that need to get done are pushed to the background, and the focus and attention is brought to only what is important.  

Over time the user learns what they are realistically capable of in an average day, and how to set appropriate expectations.
